  Simple demo GUI app, used to evaluate formulas with Formula4j.

  <P>This app is much like a simple console. 
 There is a single line at the top for the input of an expression, and an area below 
 for displaying the result of evaluating the expression with formula4j. 
 
 <P>This app has these purposes:
 <ul>
  <li>demonstrate use of formula4j's API
  <li>quickly experiment with expressions
  <li>evaluate its timing statistics 
 </ul>
 
 <P>This app is not meant to be a general-purpose GUI component.
