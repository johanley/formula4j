This tool is a simple demonstration of how to input formulas, 
evaluate them, and output their value.

Example input :
  2+3
  5.51*16.1 - 10
  (4^2 - 10) + 5.2
  abs(-90) + max(12.5, 3, -16.8)
  sin(0.125) + tan(1.231)
  round(132.5*1.2151)
  ..and so on..

As each line is evaluated, the system calculates and 
displays the response time.

---------------------------------------------------

This tool also defines the following special commands. 

:define <function-definition>
Define a custom function on the fly.
Example:
  :define bmi(m,h) = m/h^2

:set <variable-value>
Defines a variable as a name-value pair.
Defined variables can be referenced in formulas.
Setting a variable a second time simply overwrites the value.
Example:
  :set a = 321.2

:unset [<variable-name>]
Remove a variable value. 
If the variable name is omitted, then all variables are removed.
  
:stats
Show timing statistics.

:load <file-name>
Load a file defining custom functions.
The file name should be absolute, not relative.
The file should be encoded in UTF-8.
The file must contain content that looks like this:

bmi(m,h) = m/h^2
area(r) = 2 * Ï€ * r^2
circum   my.package.Circumference

There are two kinds of entries in these files:
  - explicit functions (bmi and area)
  - mapping of function names to implementation classes (circum)

:unload
Revert to the default set of functions, with 
no customizations. Undoes both the :load and 
the :define command.
  
:cls
Clear the output area by removing all of its text.

:help
Show this help information.
